## Description
I have previously been creating an endless puzzle game that deals with procedural generation and ramping difficulty. 
It utilizes pooling and origin reseting for optimal flow.

It runs on Unity2D 2022.3.24f1.

It is left at 90% done (monetization, sound-tracking and some optimization is left).

Not much can be said prior to the official annoucement through my personal company "Volen Digital".

**Technologies Used:** C#, Unity2D, ECS, Photoshop
